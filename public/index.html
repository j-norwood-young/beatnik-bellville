		<div class="body-text">
			<p class="blurb">The city of the 21st century is a city in perpetual motion</p>

			<p><span class="drop-cap">W</span>hen one looks at a map of Cape Town and the surrounding environs, the eye is drawn to its central nervous system: Bellville, the Voortrekker Road Corridor and the Greater Tygerberg region. The hundred-square kilometre turtle-shaped conglomeration sits to the east of the coastline, in the centre of a huddle of municipalities. It’s not difficult to imagine Bellville as the hub of a wheel, while other areas of the lower Western Cape jut out like spokes. </p>

			<p>In terms of the latest urban thinking, and by dint of its location, Bellville is a superstar. As a bonus, its breaks all the usual apartheid spatial cliches—almost uniquely in South Africa, it possesses a light-industrial central business district with vast transport opportunities, affordable student accommodation, old-age homes, and thriving medical facilities. What’s more, Bellville is one of the more cosmopolitan places in South Africa — people from across the continent come here to trade. This means a huge surge of human energy: young, educated people going about their business, looking to make lives for themselves in a place that reflects, and reacts to, their needs. </p>

			<div class="pull-quote pull-quote-right">It’s not enough to leave Bellville to its own devices. It needs to be fully imagined in order to meet its potential.</div>

			<p>The city doesn’t decouple, it links. And while Bellville has very good bones, as far as the futurist urban thinker John Kasarda is concerned, the new urban region “will not likely evolve on a spontaneous, ad hoc basis. Rather, it must be guided by a shared vision, strategy, and coordinated actions among the private, public, and institutional sectors."</p>

			<p>In other words, it’s not enough to leave Bellville to its own devices. It needs to be fully imagined in order to meet its potential. </p>

			<p>The Greater Tygerberg Partnership is in the process of articulating Kasarda’s injunction. The GTP is designing the idea of the new city, using all the possibilities and partnerships at hand. The partnership looking to create a 24-hour city, a safe but restless place that counts on innovation and access to make it work for the students and young workers seeking a long-term home.</p>

			<p class="blurb">The Pop-Up City</p>
			<p><span class="drop-cap">W</span>elcome, then, to the Pop-Up City. Think of downtown Bellville as a palette, where space is made available for innovative ideas — music gigs, art installations, theatre performances, mini film studios, webinars, fashion shows, and chef’s tables. In the once dowdy strip malls of Bellville, art, play and commerce sit side by side. This isn’t about gentrification. It’s about using available space in order to invigorate the city, especially at night. In the Pop Up City programme, ideas germinate in real time. Some work. Some don’t.</p>

			<div class="pull-quote pull-quote-right">Bellville asserts itself as a place of ideas, a city that is open to voices and concepts that are normally shut out of the South African conversation.</div>

			<p>But the point is to create a rich compost of culture, one that encourages people to linger in and on the streets long after work or classes are over. </p>

			<p>The Pop Up City doesn’t usher in fundamental changes at an institutional level—that’s not the point. Rather, it highlights what Bellville’s champions believe are its advantages: the ability to innovate; the 24-hour city; the youth dividend; the transportation hub. </p>

			<p>It also makes a number of important symbolic statements. The first is that Bellville will become in part untethered from the long-term lease-based system that has always defined useable space—young people, raised on the gig economy, have stated time and again that they demand the same flexibility from service providers that is demanded from from them. </p>

			<p>The second is that Bellville asserts itself as a place of ideas, a city that is open to voices and concepts that are normally shut out of the South African conversation. </p>

			<p>The third is that this leads to a reconceptualization of the South African city: our urban conglomerations should and must become institutions that respond to demands, and not impose them. </p>

			<p class="blurb">Sister Act</p>
			<p><span class="drop-cap">C</span>ities are notoriously difficult to transform. They are always caught in a bureaucratic logjam of national, regional, and municipal interests, and often thrive or wilt based on decisions made very far away, by policymakers who have no knowledge of local requirements. It is thus important for a city’s champions to understand how to shape the and market the character of a place. </p>

			<p>If Bellville has a corollary, it is the American city Roanoke, Virginia. Near enough to Washington DC to form a dormitory community for legislators, it is also the hub in the wheel of Virginia’s municipalities. It has a number of highly advanced medical facilities, and attracts young students and others looking for reasonably priced accommodation. While Virginia remains a conservative state, Roanoke relentlessly promotes itself as globalist and cosmopolitan, and thus has a diverse, growing and thriving population that add to the tax base, and make the town immensely liveable. </p>

			<p>None of this happened by accident. Roanoke has marketed its charms relentlessly, and its champions and local councillors have intelligently guided and sold its benefits to state and national government. </p>

			<p>The first step in changing a city is imagining what it can one day become. The Pop-Up City is a statement in that direction. It isn’t policy, and it isn’t legislation. It’s a declaration. </p>
